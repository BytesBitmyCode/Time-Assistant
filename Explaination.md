### Current State of the Program

As a software engineer, I have initiated the development of a personal assistant program focused on priority task management. The first module implemented in this program is based on Stephen Covey's Time Management Matrix. This module, encapsulated in `TimeMatrix.py`, serves as a foundational component for task prioritization and management.

**Key Features:**
1. **Quadrants for Task Prioritization**: The program categorizes tasks into four quadrants:
   - Urgent and Important
   - Not Urgent but Important
   - Urgent but Not Important
   - Neither Urgent nor Important

2. **Task Management**: Users can add tasks to any of the four quadrants. Each task can optionally include a due date, enhancing the decision-making process regarding task urgency and importance.

3. **User Interaction**: The current implementation is command-line-based, providing a straightforward interface for users to input tasks, select appropriate quadrants, and assign due dates.

### Next Steps for the Program

The program is in its early stages, and I am planning several enhancements to transform it into a comprehensive personal assistant tool. The following are the key areas of focus:

1. **Modular Design**: To ensure scalability, I will refactor the program into a modular architecture. This will involve separating concerns such as task management, user interaction, and data storage into distinct modules.

2. **Object-Oriented Approach**: I intend to adopt an object-oriented approach, defining classes for tasks, users, and other relevant entities. This will facilitate easier integration of new features and improve code maintainability.

3. **Data Persistence**: Transitioning from in-memory data structures to a database system is a priority. This will allow for more robust data management and scalability.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**: I plan to develop a more user-friendly interface, potentially moving towards a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user engagement.

5. **Code Quality and Testing**: Emphasis will be placed on code documentation, robust error handling, and implementing unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

6. **Integration of Additional Features**: The Covey’s Time Management Matrix is just the beginning. I plan to integrate additional productivity and personal assistant features, ensuring seamless interaction between different modules.

7. **Performance Optimization**: As new features are added, I will continuously monitor and optimize the program’s performance, ensuring it remains efficient and responsive.

In summary, the vision for this program is to evolve it into a versatile and user-friendly personal assistant tool, catering to the needs of highly functional individuals. The journey has just begun, and I am committed to applying best practices in software engineering to achieve this goal.

### Ideas

1) The ability to add, view and Modify Description for a task.
2) Adding the option to mark a task as complete and save it in an archive database of all the past tasks completed, removing it / hiding it from the display tasks.
3) Flagging tasks Aproaching deadlines to ensure that no deadlines are violated.
4) Adding the amount of time it should take to complete a task. This will be used in the future to help with proper planing and time alocation (Eventually being used for when the pamadora technique is added to the program.)
5) Implemeting a Chat Bot into the Program for interacting with the Program.
6) Implementing a DB in the program.
7) Create an education moduel that will strore document and info (like books) to be later user for machine learing base on the users end goals.
